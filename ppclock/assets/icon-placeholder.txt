PPClock Add-in Icons

For a production add-in, you would need these icon files:
- icon-16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon-32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon-80.png (80x80 pixels)

These should be professional-looking timer/clock icons that represent your add-in.

For development/testing, the add-in will work without these files, but you'll see broken image icons in the ribbon.

Icon Requirements:
- PNG format
- Transparent background recommended
- Simple, recognizable design
- Consistent color scheme
- Professional appearance

Suggested Design:
- Clock face with countdown styling
- PowerPoint-compatible colors
- Clear visibility at small sizes
