[User Enhancement Request - Zero Minutes Support]
✅ Modified all three versions to allow zero minutes with seconds-only countdown
✅ Updated Python version (ppclock.py):
   - Changed minvalue from 1 to 0 for minutes input dialog
   - Added validation to ensure at least 1 second total time
   - Added warning message for 0 minutes + 0 seconds input
✅ Verified Web version (ppclock_web.html):
   - Already supported min="0" for minutes input
   - Already had proper validation logic in startTimer function
✅ Verified PowerPoint add-in (ppclock_addon.html):
   - Already supported min="0" for minutes input
   - Already had proper validation with Office.js dialog display

NEW FUNCTIONALITY ENABLED:
- 0 minutes, 30 seconds = 30-second countdown
- 0 minutes, 10 seconds = 10-second timer
- 0 minutes, 5 seconds = quick 5-second countdown
- All versions maintain minimum 1-second requirement
- Clear error handling for invalid 0+0 time input

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- Python: Updated simpledialog.askinteger minvalue parameter
- Web/Add-in: HTML input min attribute already set to "0"
- All versions: Proper validation prevents zero-time countdown
- User-friendly error messages across all platforms

This enhancement makes PPClock more versatile for short-duration timing needs while maintaining robust input validation!

[User Enhancement Request - Font Size Options]
PLANNING PHASE:
- Add font size selection for countdown display across all three versions
- Implement size options: Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large
- Maintain responsive design and readability
- Store user preference during session

IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:
1. Python version: Add font size selection dialog and dynamic font updates
2. Web version: Add font size dropdown with CSS class switching
3. PowerPoint add-in: Add font size controls optimized for task pane
4. Update all versions to remember font size choice during session

TARGET FONT SIZES:
- Small: 16px/12pt (compact display)
- Medium: 20px/15pt (default)
- Large: 32px/24pt (presentation mode)
- Extra Large: 48px/36pt (visibility from distance)

PYTHON VERSION IMPLEMENTATION:

✅ Font options: Small (12pt), Medium (16pt), Large (24pt), Extra Large (36pt)
✅ Updated create_countdown_window() to use dynamic font size
✅ Integrated font selection into start_countdown() workflow
✅ Professional dialog with OK/Cancel buttons and proper styling

TECHNICAL DETAILS - PYTHON:
- Radio button dialog using tk.Toplevel with grab_set() for modal behavior
- Dynamic font configuration: font=('Arial', self.font_size, 'bold')
- Font selection occurs after time input, before countdown window creation
- Maintains tkinter styling consistency with blue/gray button theme

WEB VERSION IMPLEMENTATION:

- Responsive sizing for both main timer and draggable popup window
- Font selection stored in this.fontSizeClass and applied to both displays
- Maintains visual consistency with smooth animations

POWERPOINT ADD-IN IMPLEMENTATION:
✅ Added CSS font size classes optimized for task pane constraints
✅ Created compact dropdown selector integrated with Office styling
✅ Font sizes: 1.8em/2.5em/3em/4em with adjusted padding for each size
